# Capstone-Project---Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
    INTRODUCTION:


In latest years, with the fast development of electronic commerce, the numbers of e- commerce groups are booming increasingly and on a big scale, and the service has come to be more and more homogeneous, making opposition extra intense among e-commerce organizations. underneath an ecommerce environment, businesses use the internet platform to service clients, customers browse the community platform, the shopping for manner produces a huge quantity of information traffic, and the visitors within the form of information is straightforward to get admission to for any ecommerce agencies. based on the precise benefits of ecommerce groups, huge quantities of statistics thru records mining, statistics wishes to get clients, offer customers with personalized service, and continuously enhance consumer pride and loyalty, which has turn out to be the main intention of the e-trade international.



Problem Statement:

In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK- based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


Methodology:


Although the data used must be kept private, it is critical to compare the results with other conventional machine learning algorithms to demonstrate the significance of the positives and negatives of each method considered in this study. This section explains the algorithms used in this study in detail. Iâ€™ve done preprocessing, handled null values, created required features, done Exploratory data analysis, done some feature engineering, created RFM model(recency, frequency and monetary value),created clusters, and at last done prediction using classification.


CONCLUSIONS:

a.)So finally, we can conclude here!
Starting with loading the data so far, we have done Data cleaning, handled Null values, EDA, encoding of categorical columns, feature

b.) selection, model building and then 
Evaluation of the model with 
different evaluation metrics.
We've got the model accuracy in 
the range of 66% to 90%.

c.) So, the accuracy of our best model 
is 90% which is by XGBoost 
so, Xgboost is our optimal model.
